She is out of the Stakes winning mare Cartimandua and by Cacique who covers a limited book of mares, but he has a fantastic strike rate with those foals he does get on the ground. He has produced 21% black type performers from foals of racing age and having raced two of his best progeny; Dominant and Census, we are extremely happy to be adding this stunning filly into our syndicates. Contentment ran three times as a two-year-old and was unlucky not to break her maiden having bumped into the subsequent Oh So Sharp Stakes (Gr 3) winner Poet’s Vanity when second at Salisbury. She is a filly with plenty of class about her and is an exciting prospect for 2017.`,

Simple Verse, the 2015 St Leger winner, was still in front a few strides from the line but had nothing more to give as Dartmouth stayed on strongly to win by a neck.`,
